- [Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge](https://canaveral.tours/merritt-island-wildlife-refuge/): Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge spans roughly 140 000 acres between the Atlantic and the Indian River Lagoon. NASA set the land aside as a buffer for Kennedy Space Center in 1963, and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service turned the unused expanse into a sanctuary. Wetlands, pine flatwoods, oak scrub, and open lagoon water now support one of the richest wildlife collections in Florida. Palms and marsh beside a quiet refuge road. History NASA bought most of Merritt Island in 1962 to secure launch safety zones. Engineers built pads and towers on a small […]
- [A Living Light](https://canaveral.tours/a-living-light/): The Cape Canaveral Lighthouse has stood on the cape for over 150 years. In the beginning, the current lighthouse was located about a mile and a half east toward the tip of Cape Canaveral. It was not, however, the first lighthouse located on the cape. The first tower, built of brick, was just 65 feet tall. After many mariners voiced their concern that this structure was not tall enough to sufficiently warn ships of the abundance of shoals just off the cape shores, the government approved the construction of the current tower. Today’s lighthouse was originally built about 80 to 90 […]
- [Area History](https://canaveral.tours/area-history/): Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge began with the development of the US Space Program. In 1962, NASA acquired 140,000 acres of land adjacent to the existing USAF launch facility on Cape Canaveral and established the John F. Kennedy Space Center. NASA built a launch complex and support facilities, but most of the land was left in its native condition. Some of the land had been improved by residents who had been bought out by the government, and a few were given permission to stay for a time. Some orange groves were allowed to remain and […]
